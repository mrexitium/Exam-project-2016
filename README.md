## Setup GIT

### Mac users

#### Step 1

Install Git on your computer with this link


```
http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3
```

#### Step 2

Go to [github](http://github.com/) and create a user. After that tell me your Github user name so I can add you to the project.

#### Step 3

In the terminal go to your local project folder on your local server, and use this command:
```
$ git init
```

Then clone the repository with

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mrexitium/Exam-project-2016.git
```
Then you can set up Git so it is easier to use by running these commands
```
$ git config --global user.name "github username"
$ git config --global user.email youremail@gmail.com
```
You are now ready to do some work!

#### Step 4

When you start something new start by checking if your local code is up to date with the online repository by using
```
$ git pull
```
Then you can start working on a file, whenever you want to save that file you use

```
$ git add *
$ git pull
$ git commit -m "Message description of what you changed"
$ git push origin master
```
You can at all times check which files you have changed since your last commit by using 
```
$ git status
```
